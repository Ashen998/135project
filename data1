#discarding categorical variable(I also discard the "ID" collumn as I think it can be meaningless)

#the 3rd, 20th and 28th are outliers of Length;
#the 20th and 27th are outliers of Gestation;

#Using correlation matrix will standardize variables, so we tend to use it when variable scales are not silmilar.
#On the contrary, when the scales are similar, we prefer the covariance one.

fviz_pca_biplot(pca1)
#from the biplot, birthweight,gestation,length,mother's height are highly positively correlated; since these form nearly a 90 degree angle from father, mother's age, father's education level, they are not so correlated with each other. Also fathers' height seem to be highly negatively correlated with numbers of cigarettes smoked by mother as they form nearly a 180 degree angle. And the cigarettes smoked also negatively correlated with babies' status.

#recording newdata
newborn <- data.frame("Length"=61, "Birthweight"=5.1, "Headcirc"=36, "Gestation"=43, "mage"=43, "mnocig"=7, "mheight"=165, "mppwt"=64, "fage"=38, "fedyrs"=19, "fnocig"=45, "fheight"=189)

#predicting using previous PCA
pr1 <- predict(pca1, newdata = newborn)
pr1[,1:5]

options(max.overlaps = Inf)
p <- fviz_pca_ind(pca1)
#Add newborn individual
fviz_add(p, pr1, color ="blue")
#the new individual seem to be a extreme point away from the data crowd. As we can compare from the data, the new individual has his father,mother's age and cigarette smoked per day same as the maximum of the original data.

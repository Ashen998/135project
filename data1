ncol(rawdata)

#discarding categorical variable(I also discard the "ID" collumn as I think it can be meaningless)
#(we can also drop the "length","head circumference" of babies and "gestation" if we want to discuss the effect mainly by smoking)
#(or we can use them same as birthweight as a dependant variable)
smbb = subset(rawdata,select = -c(ID,smoker,lowbwt,mage35)) 
head(smbb)

#Finding standing out individuals(outliers)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
dotchart(smbb$Birthweight)
pc = (boxplot(smbb$Birthweight,horizontal = T))
pc$out
#we have 0 outlier in the birthweight data
#trying to use star plot
stars(smbb)
#we can discuss here which one seems different than the others

#Using correlation matrix will standardize variables, so we tend to use it when variable scales are not silmilar.
#On the contrary, when the scales are similar, we prefer the covariance one.
pca1 = prcomp(smbb,scale = T)
summary(pca1)
biplot(pca1)
#headcirc as pc1, and mnocig as pc2
